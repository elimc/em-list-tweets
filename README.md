FAQ
---

__Why did a lot of the Twitter widgets for WordPress recently break?__

Twitter is now using oAuth to validate users. You can no longer grab a simple JSON stream from any user and display its contents.

__Why did they do that?__

I can only assume that they have an evil corporate agenda.

__What's wrong with JetPack?__

It doesn't let me do things on my development servers without signing up for WordPress.com

__Can I fork this, improve it, and send it back to you?__

YES! The more eyeballs that are refactoring my code to make it more secure, terse, and speedy, the better.

__Should I use safety goggles with this widget?__

It's up to you. So far, there have been no industrial accidents involving more than 27 people with this widget.
